# A-functional-blog

 functional blog with Mysql and PHP
 Well this was to check on my routing skill using PHP. Being able to click on a post and it is able to show you content.
 I was excited about this one but there was no UI just functionality.
 ## I wanted to achieve the following:
 - fetch data from a mysql database
 - Filter data and display it on the "ui" part
 - Route the links to a page to show the contents
 - Post a blog to the database
 - Learn how to do routing of dynamic content
 *Yes i achieved this and PHP was exciting*
 
 ## I used
 - PHP
 - MYSQL
 - HTML
 
 **Well you may say it is not functional** but i was aiming for fuctionality.
